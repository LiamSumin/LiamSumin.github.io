      - role: the president of the academic club (Selfcar)
        time: 2021 - 2022
        company: CBNU, Korea
        details: |
          Selfcar is a team founded in 2018 by students at Chungbuk University who are passionate about autonomous driving. 
          When I joined the club in 2021, I took on responsibility in areas such as object detection and localization for competitions utilizing GPS and IMU. 
          In 2022, I became the president of the club, where I managed and implemented code in all aspects of perception, decision-making, and control, in addition to my previous responsibilities. 
          Despite difficulties in 2021 due to a lack of skills and sensor errors on the day of the competition in 2022, I was able to get significant experience and learn a lot via these projects.

        details: |
          I was the president of Tensor, an academic club associated with Chungbuk National University's Department of Intelligent Robotics Engineering.
          The club was founded when the department was formed, and it will separate from the Department of Electrical Engineering in 2021.
          Our primary purpose was to do artificial intelligence and computer vision research and to prepare for various competitions.
          Throughout my presidency, I had the opportunity to learn how leadership and the courses in my degree were implemented in an environment of collaboration.
